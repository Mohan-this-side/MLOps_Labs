## 🎯 What Was Created

This lab demonstrates a complete, production-ready machine learning pipeline using Apache Airflow. Unlike the original reference lab (which used K-Means clustering), this implementation showcases:

### Key Differentiators

1. **Different Dataset**
   - Original: Credit card customer clustering data
   - This Lab: Red Wine Quality from Kaggle
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

2. **Different ML Task**
   - Original: Unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering)
   - This Lab: Supervised learning (Binary classification)

3. **Different Algorithm**
   - Original: K-Means with elbow method
   - This Lab: Random Forest with cross-validation

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Feature engineering with domain knowledge
   - Comprehensive evaluation metrics
   - Cross-validation for robust assessment
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Detailed performance reports

## 🔄 The ML Pipeline (4 Tasks)

### Task 1: Load Wine Data
**Function:** `load_wine_data()`
- Reads Red Wine Quality CSV (1,599 samples, 12 columns)
- Displays dataset overview and statistics
- Checks data quality (missing values, distributions)
- Serializes data for next task via XCom

**Output:** Serialized DataFrame + statistics

### Task 2: Feature Engineering
**Function:** `perform_feature_engineering(data)`
- Creates binary target: Good wine (≥6) vs Bad wine (<6)
- Engineers 3 new features:
  1. `alcohol_to_density` - Alcohol relative to density
  2. `acid_ratio` - Fixed/volatile acidity ratio
  3. `sulfur_ratio` - Free/total sulfur dioxide ratio
- Splits data: 80% train, 20% test (stratified)
- Applies StandardScaler (prevents data leakage)

**Output:** Scaled train/test arrays + feature names + scaler

### Task 3: Train Model
**Function:** `train_random_forest_model(data, filename)`
- Configures Random Forest (100 trees, max_depth=10)
- Runs 5-fold cross-validation
- Trains final model on full training set
- Calculates feature importance scores
- Saves model and scaler to disk

**Output:** Training metrics (CV scores, feature importances)

### Task 4: Evaluate Model
**Function:** `evaluate_model_performance(filename, training_results)`
- Loads saved model
- Makes predictions on test set
- Calculates comprehensive metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Sensitivity & Specificity
  - True/False Positives/Negatives
- Compares train vs test performance
- Saves JSON report

**Output:** Evaluation report (dictionary + JSON file)

## 💡 Code Quality Highlights

### Human-Like Writing Style
✅ **Extensive comments** explaining WHY not just WHAT  
✅ **Descriptive variable names** (`good_count`, `X_train_scaled`)  
✅ **Clear function docstrings** with Args, Returns, Description  
✅ **Informative print statements** with emojis and formatting  
✅ **Step-by-step explanations** in comments  
✅ **Domain context** (e.g., why we engineer certain features)  

### Best Practices Demonstrated
✅ **Data leakage prevention** (scaler fit only on training data)  
✅ **Stratified splitting** (maintains class balance)  
✅ **Cross-validation** (robust performance estimation)  
✅ **Model persistence** (save/load for reproducibility)  
✅ **Comprehensive logging** (detailed task outputs)  
✅ **Error handling** (division by zero, NaN values)  
✅ **Modular design** (each function = one responsibility)  

### Documentation Excellence
✅ **Complete README** with setup, usage, troubleshooting  
✅ **Inline comments** throughout all code  
✅ **Visual diagrams** in README and DAG file  
✅ **Learning outcomes** section  
✅ **Real-world context** (production considerations)
